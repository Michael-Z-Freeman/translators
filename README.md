HISTORY

This translator was something I've been circling around for 3 years. I started a BA(Hons) in Creative Music Technology at Falmouth University. I became frustrated with the lack of citation tools for music releases and audio recordings in general. Zotero does detect the Discogs page as an audio recording but does not fill in the correct details. Other citation tools out there fail to have searches for music releases and seem to have no idea that vinyl records can in fact be cited and referenced. All this when as a DJ I am researching releases and writing assessments and dissertations ! So I hope this translator can improve the situation.

METHOD

This translator accesses the "ld+json" block in the "release" Discogs page. It is not designed to use the "master" page for a release as that will not list the record label.
